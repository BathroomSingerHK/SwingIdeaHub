🚀Weekly Outlook: January 5th - January 9th Focus: Absent Christmas rally, nuclear energy sector surge, abnormal fund flows in BABA (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent). The Big Picture: Santa Rally Failed. "A lot of noise, little meaning"—this best summarizes last week's market performance.

The S&P 500 disappointed during the traditional "Christmas rally" period (5 days before the end of the year + 2 days before the beginning of the new year), ranking last among major global markets. In stark contrast, the Taiwan and South Korean markets surged, driven by demand for AI hardware. The market's problem wasn't bad news, but a lack of new information. Market sentiment was dovish, reinforcing expectations of future rate cuts, but failing to alleviate persistent pressure on long-term yields or boost risk appetite. Trading volume was extremely low, and cross-asset price fluctuations resembled year-end adjustments rather than a reflection of market confidence. Even intraday volatility in silver or tech stocks was unsustainable after the liquidity crunch. Current US Stock Market Status: The liquidity crunch at the end of 2025 is causing prices to oscillate within a narrow range. While the VIX is low, the market lacks the fuel to push for new highs. 2026 Macroeconomic Theme: The "Decoupling" of GDP and the Job Market. Strong GDP (Q4 Forecast +1%): Despite the impact of the government shutdown, economic growth remains resilient, supported by an AI-driven productivity surge (Q3 Forecast +5.4%). Weak Employment (Unemployment Rate 4.6%): Businesses are using AI to increase output rather than hiring more people. This will force the Fed to cut interest rates by 100 bps in 2026 to support the labor market.

Week Ahead: Key Economic Calendar. This week's data is relatively light; the focus is on the employment data's guidance on the Fed's interest rate path.

Monday (Jan 5):

10:00 ISM Manufacturing (Forecast 48.3): Expected to remain in contraction territory, but the employment sub-index may improve.

Wednesday (Jan 7):

10:00 ISM Services: Focus on whether the service sector is supported by employment.

10:00 Job Openings: Estimated 7.7M. Lower than expected would strengthen the case for a rate cut.

Thursday (Jan 8):

08:30 Productivity: Estimated +5.4% (Blockbuster!). This is solid evidence of AI improving efficiency, positive for tech stock fundamentals.

Earnings: This week's earnings reports are relatively quiet (Second-tier names only), such as Acuity (AYI) and Commercial Metals (CMC). Market focus is mainly on macroeconomic data.

Friday (Jan 9):

08:30 Nonfarm Payrolls: Estimated +80k, unemployment rate 4.6%. This is the highlight of the week. Weak data will lead to a decline in US Treasury yields, positive for growth stocks.
